Managing tasks effectively

I'm thinking about how to manage tasks using the tool guidance, where I can only mark one task as in-progress at a time. I should summarize after completing each task and ensure calls to manage the to-do list are careful. It's crucial to update only one item as in-progress and keep others as not-started. This approach helps demonstrate progress, and I need to format my final answer clearly, avoiding excess headings and ensuring clarity.

Documenting Git commands

I need to compile the commands I used during the process. This includes checking for installed git with Get-Command git, attempting to install Git via winget install Git.Git, testing paths with Test-Path, and running the git executable. I encountered issues with HTTP proxy settings, which I resolved by configuring the git proxy. I also fixed secret scanning issues by amending my commits and ensuring the main branch was properly set. Lastly, I verified the existence of .gitignore.

Configuring Git and SSH

I created an alias for git since the default wasn't in the PATH, using the LocalAppData Programs Git path. I conducted SSH tests, but both attempts timed out. Instead, I switched to HTTPS with a proxy. I need to present the commands in fenced code blocks with a PowerShell language tag for clarity. Additionally, I should remind about setting a global git identity and possibly removing the proxy configuration later. Lastly, I amended my commit to purge secrets and pushed successfully, ensuring no sensitive content is shown.

Managing tasks with todos

I won't use any tools right now, but the requirement states I must utilize the to-do list tool. I’ll call manage_todo_list with three tasks:
Summarize git setup steps - in-progress
Compile commands used - not started
Document issues and fixes - not started
After I deliver the summary, I can mark all tasks as completed in a second call. I’ll make sure to provide progress updates after a few calls while keeping everything concise. Let's proceed!


Setup Summary

Git availability: Used local install at "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Git\cmd\git.exe" and created a session alias.
Repo state: Initialized on main, made the initial commit, and added .gitignore (already present).
Remote: Added origin (https://github.com/marieswaripalanimarimuthu-stack/MyProject) and pushed main.
Network: Configured Git to use corporate proxy and Windows SSL to fix HTTPS connectivity.
Security: Removed secrets flagged by GitHub push protection and amended the commit.
Commands Used

Check/install tools:


Get-Command git
Get-Command winget
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget

Locate and run Git executable:
Test-Path "C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe"
Test-Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Git\cmd\git.exe"
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Git\cmd\git.exe" --version
Set-Alias git "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\Git\cmd\git.exe"
git --version
Repo initialization and branch:
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
git symbolic-ref HEAD
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git status -sb





Remote setup and push (HTTPS):
git remote -v
git remote add origin https://github.com/marieswaripalanimarimuthu-stack/MyProject
git push -u origin main

Network diagnostics and proxy configuration:
netsh winhttp show proxy
Get-ItemProperty "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings" |
  Select-Object ProxyEnable, ProxyServer, AutoConfigURL | Format-List
git config --global http.proxy http://chnproxy.verizon.com:80
git config --global https.proxy http://chnproxy.verizon.com:80
git config --global http.sslBackend schannel
git ls-remote origin

SSH checks (blocked, used for diagnosis only):
Get-Command ssh
ssh -T git@github.com
ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com

Secret remediation and amended commit:

Edited RCASteps.txt and mcp-server/.env.example to remove tokens
git add RCASteps.txt mcp-server/.env.example
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push -u origin main

Issues Faced

Git not in PATH: Get-Command git failed; resolved by using local install path and Set-Alias.
Branch detection: Initial VS Code log showed “No such branch: main” before first commit; resolved after initial commit on main.
HTTPS push failed: Recv failure: Connection was reset due to corporate proxy; fixed by setting http/https.proxy and http.sslBackend schannel.
SSH blocked: Timeouts on ports 22 and 443; stayed on HTTPS with proxy.
Push protection blocked: GitHub detected secrets in RCASteps.txt and .env.example; removed/redacted them and amended the commit, then push succeeded.


Optional Next Steps



Set global identity:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

If the proxy isn’t needed outside corporate network, unset later:
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
