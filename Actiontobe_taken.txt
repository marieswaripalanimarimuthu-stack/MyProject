Notes and limits

Writing results back into “a separate tab in the same spreadsheet” requires Google Sheets API credentials or an Apps Script web app. Since the CSV is public read-only, I implemented local CSV export. If you can provide a service account JSON or an Apps Script endpoint, I can wire a “Push to Sheet” button next.
The entitystep matching is substring-based as requested. If you want exact matches or regex support, I can add a toggle.
Want me to:

Add a global “Validate All Visible Rows” that batches and zips multiple result CSVs?
Wire up Google Sheets write via Apps Script if you provide a Web App URL?
